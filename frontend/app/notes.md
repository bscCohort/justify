# App Notes

Importance
- The `app` folder is the routing layer in Next.js App Router.
- Each folder maps to a URL path, and `page.tsx` defines the screen.
- Layout and global styles live here and apply across pages.

Major concepts covered here
- File-based routing (`/`, `/new`, `/cases`, `/cases/[id]`).
- Static vs. client components (`"use client"`).
- Dynamic routes and route params (`[id]`).
- Page-level composition: wiring hooks + components together.
