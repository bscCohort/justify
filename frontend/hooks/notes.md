# Hooks Notes

Importance
- Hooks isolate screen logic so pages stay readable.
- They centralize async calls, state, and side effects.
- Custom hooks make logic reusable across pages.

Major concepts covered here
- `useState` for local UI state.
- `useEffect` for data loading and sync with route params.
- Async actions with loading/error handling.
- Exposing hook APIs (state + actions) to components.
