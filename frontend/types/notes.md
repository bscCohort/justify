# Types Notes

Importance
- Types define the shared data contract for the frontend.
- They keep components, hooks, and API calls aligned.
- Type safety prevents common runtime mistakes early.

Major concepts covered here
- Type aliases and interfaces for domain models.
- Union types for constrained values (like status).
- Shared types reused across UI and data layers.
